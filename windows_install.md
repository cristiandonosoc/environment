# Windows Install

Windows is an unfortunate beast in that there is no good way to install tmux. The best I have been
able to muster is using the console in Neovim.

The installation of Neovim is pretty similar to the one on Linux.

## Useful stuff

There are a couple of useful stuff:

### Clink

[Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/) is a cmd line enhancer for windows, which uses readline
functionality so your shell will have a lot of the flaver of your linux command line
(ctrl-A, U, E, R). Overall feels more decent. You can get it from here. You can set the autorun so
that cmd.exe loads it at startup.

### Autorun

You can use the following answer to run something whenever a new shell runs:
